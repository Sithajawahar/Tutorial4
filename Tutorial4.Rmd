```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.align = "center")
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Learning to reference figures {#Figures}
```{r Figref, fig.cap= "This is random noise"}
x = seq(1:100)
y = rnorm(100)
dat = data.frame(x, y)
ggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
geom_line()

```

In figure \@ref(fig:Figref), we have plot x versus y 

# Learning to reference Tables {#Tables}

```{r Tabref}
knitr::kable(head(dat, n=5), caption = "These are the first 5 rows")

```

In table \@ref(tab:Tabref), we show the first 5 rows 

# Conclusion 

In section \@ref(Figures), we reference figures & In section \@ref(Tables) 

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
